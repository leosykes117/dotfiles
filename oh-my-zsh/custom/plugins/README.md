# Plugins

> Note: You need to create a symlink for the specific plugin that you want:

```bash
ln -sfn ./oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME
```

> Note: If you prefer, you can create a symlink for all `plugin` directory instead:

```bash
ln -sfn ./oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins
```
